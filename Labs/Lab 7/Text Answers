Recurrence relation: c(n) =  Î£_(m=1)^(n) (n-1 + c(m-1) + c(n-m)) / n

Average case: O(n log n)
Worst case:   O(n^2), unlikely because would require choosing the min/max
              element for each pivot, but because the pivot is randomized, it
              it would be very difficult for the extreme values to be chosen
              consistently
Properties: Not in-place, as it uses logarithmic additional memory to store the
            stack frames of the recursive calls.
            Not stable, as the swap does not account for equal keys, and does
            not preserve order.
