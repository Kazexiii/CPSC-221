For teams, rough breakdown of work:

We pair programmed the entire project, so the workload was fairly even.


What's the most useful tool or idea you learned on this project?

We learned how to use gdb/lldb to fix failing tests, and we also were able to
learn how to use our respective text editors (SublimeTest, vi) efficiently.


What was the most frustrating issue to resolve on this project? 

Given that neither of us was particularly familiar with C++ syntax, ensuring
that our code was able to compile and follow the style was slightly frustrating,
as the compiler often did not have particularly useful tips as to how to fix
said errors. Using a text editor mainly instead of an IDE for the first time was
a bit of a struggle, as we greatly missed the code completion and project
management features.
